Due to the lack of time that I have based on my work schedule I was not able to fully complete this hw assignment.

It definitely proved to be a challenge, and I spent most of my free time debugging as I continue to learn Express routing. I got really close though, and I plan to complete it soon.

All that was left for me to do was to create an event handler for my modal so that it would populate the match on screen for the client, after the client submits their survey. That and the last bit of logic in my "app.post"(apiRoutes) that would compute the survey results to gather that specific match.
